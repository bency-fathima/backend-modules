# JavaScript Loops: while and do...while

## Introduction
Loops in JavaScript are used to execute a block of code repeatedly as long as a specified condition is true. The `while` and `do...while` loops are two commonly used looping structures.

## while Loop
The `while` loop executes a block of code as long as the specified condition evaluates to `true`.

### Syntax
```javascript
while (condition) {
    // Code to execute while condition is true
}
```

### Explanation
1. The `while` loop checks the condition before executing the loop body.
2. If the condition is `true`, the block of code runs.
3. The loop repeats until the condition becomes `false`.

### Example
```javascript
let count = 1;

while (count <= 5) {
    console.log("Count: " + count);
    count++;
}
```

### Output
```
Count: 1
Count: 2
Count: 3
Count: 4
Count: 5
```

## do...while Loop
The `do...while` loop is similar to the `while` loop, but it guarantees that the block of code executes at least once before checking the condition.

### Syntax
```javascript
do {
    // Code to execute
} while (condition);
```

### Explanation
1. The block of code inside `do` executes once before checking the condition.
2. If the condition evaluates to `true`, the loop continues.
3. The loop repeats until the condition becomes `false`.

### Example
```javascript
let num = 1;

do {
    console.log("Number: " + num);
    num++;
} while (num <= 5);
```

### Output
```
Number: 1
Number: 2
Number: 3
Number: 4
Number: 5
```

## Difference Between while and do...while
| Feature       | while Loop | do...while Loop |
|--------------|------------|----------------|
| Condition Check | Before execution | After execution |
| Execution Guarantee | Might not execute | Executes at least once |

## Conclusion
The `while` and `do...while` loops are useful for repeated execution of code based on a condition. Use `while` when the condition should be checked first, and `do...while` when at least one execution is required.
