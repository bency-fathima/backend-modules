# Comparison of Programming, Scripting, Markup, and Stylesheet Languages

## 1. Programming Languages (e.g., JavaScript)

### Characteristics:
- Used to develop full applications with logic, data manipulation, and interactivity.
- Supports control structures like loops, conditionals, and functions.
- Can run on different platforms (e.g., browsers, servers, mobile apps).

### Example:
```js
function greet(name) {
    return `Hello, ${name}!`;
}
console.log(greet("World"));
```

### Use Cases:
- Web development (Frontend and Backend)
- Game development
- Mobile applications
- Automation

## 2. Scripting Languages (e.g., Python, Bash, Perl)

### Characteristics:
- Usually interpreted rather than compiled.
- Often used for automating tasks, system administration, and rapid prototyping.
- Can be embedded within other software (e.g., JavaScript in HTML, Lua in games).

### Example:
```python
def greet(name):
    return f"Hello, {name}!"
print(greet("World"))
```

### Use Cases:
- Task automation (e.g., shell scripts, cron jobs)
- Data processing and analysis
- Web development (Backend scripting)
- System administration

## 3. Markup Languages (e.g., HTML, XML)

### Characteristics:
- Used to structure and present content.
- Do not include logic or control structures.
- Define document format, structure, or data representation.

### Example (HTML):
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>My Page</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
</body>
</html>
```

### Use Cases:
- Webpage structure (HTML)
- Data interchange (XML, JSON)
- Document formatting (Markdown, LaTeX)

## 4. Stylesheet Languages (e.g., CSS, SCSS)

### Characteristics:
- Used to control the appearance and styling of documents or applications.
- Define colors, fonts, layouts, and responsive design.
- Usually applied alongside markup languages like HTML.

### Example (CSS):
```css
body {
    background-color: #f4f4f4;
    font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
}
h1 {
    color: blue;
}
```

### Use Cases:
- Web design and UI styling
- Theming for applications
- Print styling and animations

| Programming        | Full application development, logic, automation | JavaScript, Python |
| Scripting          | Task automation, rapid development       | Bash, Python, Perl |
| Markup             | Document structure, data representation  | HTML, XML |
| Stylesheet         | Visual styling, layouts, animations      | CSS, SCSS |
